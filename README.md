# HERMIT Benchmark Suite [![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release-pre/ankurlimaye/HERMIT-BenchmarkSuite.svg)](https://github.com/ankurlimaye/HERMIT-BenchmarkSuite/releases) 

The HERMIT benchmark suite is a collection of applications from the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) domain. The primary goal of HERMIT is to facilitate research into new microarchitectures and optimizations that will enable efficient execution of emerging IoMT applications. HERMIT comprises of applications spanning various domains in the healthcare industry, including Computerized Tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), implantable heart monitors, wearable devices. HERMIT also includes supplementary applications for security and data compression.
