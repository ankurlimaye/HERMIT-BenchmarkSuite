------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains the code for the RadonAna program used to generate
sinograms and corresponding images from primitives. 

goto the RadonAna directory and type `make'. Assuming that you have
gcc this should generate RadonAna.  The RadonAna program is described
in radonana.ps.gz found in the doc dir.

RadonAna uses .ini-files for generation of the images and sinograms. 
Sampling parameters and the parameters of the primitives are set here. Then
try run

RadonAna phantom.ini

which generates phantom1a.fif (the image) and phantom1r.fif (the sinogram)
in the fif-format specified in tools/imgtools.h and tools/imgtools.c. The 
program can also write matlab-files, .dat-files and gif-files BUT HERE
THE SAMPLING PARAMETERS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FILES.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

A huge package for direct 2D reconstruction 'iradon' is found in the
iradon directory. Go to the iradon directory and do make, then try

iradon i1.ini 

In i1.ini correct InFile to the actual sinogram and correct OutFile to
a new output image.

A larger description of iradon is given in the top of iradon.c.

A lot of different reconstruction methods are possible!!

            NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW NEW

Now we have included a fast iterative reconstruction package `it'. Go
to the it directory and do a `make'. A description is provided in the
to of `it.c'.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

After building the programs, copy them to /usr/local/bin or alike or
use soft-links. Use show (found in utils) to view the images and
sinograms. The shell script uses xv for showing the images.
In `utils' additional shell scripts are found which can be used to 
convert files between different formats (convert is the generic one).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of the files include some documentation which can be stripped using
clat found in the clat directory.

Go to the clat directory and run `clat_all_cfiles'. This will generate
a documentation file `clat.dvi'.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
System requirements

Un*x system with GNU C-compiler and xv is very useful. With some
modifications the code shold work on any Un*x system (SGI cc is
reported ok). ANSI-C is needed !!!

GNU make can be necessary

[[Linux is the best ]]
